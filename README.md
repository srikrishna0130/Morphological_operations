## Introduction

Morphological operations are a set of operations that process an image based on its shape. They are typically performed on binary images, i.e., images with two pixel values: black and white. This repository provides basic functions to perform such operations.

You can directly use them in your project by cloning this repo or directly using the functions in morpy.py
